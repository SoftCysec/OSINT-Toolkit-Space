OSINT-Toolkit-Space enables open source intelligence ("OSINT") practitioners to jumpstart their investigations by quickly identifying relevant, publicly-available tools and resources, saving valuable time during investigations, research, and analysis.</p>
    
## What is OSINT?
Open source intelligence (“OSINT”) is ***intelligence derived from open sources***. ***Intelligence*** refers to raw information that has been analyzed or contextualized. ***Open source*** refers to information that virtually anyone can access, usually over the internet.

OSINT’s definition is often extended to other forms of information/data, which may be publicly available and [“free”](https://www.popsci.com/technology/data-brokers-explained/), but which require something like registering with an email in order to obtain it.
## What is OSINT-Toolkit-Space?
OSINT-Toolkit-Space is a free and openly available aggregation of "top" tools & resources intended to help jumpstart OSINT investigations. OSINT-Toolkit-Space was built by a former OSINT analyst & investigator to help answer questions like "I wonder if there’s a way to find __ specific piece of information online?"

By compiling and prioritizing among thousands of tools and resources, OSINT-Toolkit-Space seeks to help OSINT practitioners intuitively surface the most relevant resources much more quickly. OSINT-Toolkit-Space was published in 2024 and received two rounds of major updates in 2022 & 2023.
